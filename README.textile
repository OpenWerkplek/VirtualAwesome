Welcome to the VirtualAwesome framework.

_va_ is a cross-platform framework that is continuously tested on Xcode (OSX),
bode::blocks (Linux), Visual Studio 9 (Windows), and Makefiles (OSX, Linux). 
Each release comes with all necessary dependencies and is easy to build. If
this is not the case and you run into issues please let us know on the
discussion list: http://groups.google.com/group/va-users

The project files for the preferred build system/IDE can be generated with
cmake. On all supported platforms you can download the graphical cmake utility
(cmake-gui) and do this with a few clicks. For details check the documentation
wiki: http://code.google.com/p/virtualawesome/wiki/GettingStarted

If you are on the bleeding edge and want to work directly with the git/svn
files make sure you also get all the support libraries. Precompiled drop-in
packages can copied from the release package. Hit the discussion list if you
have questions.
