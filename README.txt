Welcome to the VirtualAwesome library.

_va_ is a cross-platform library that is continuously tested on Xcode (OSX),
bode::blocks (Linux), Visual Studio 9 (Windows), and Makefiles (OSX, Linux). 
The Source code comes with all necessary dependencies and is
easy to build. If this is not the case and you run into issues please let us know on the discussion list: http://groups.google.com/group/va-users

The project files for the preferred build system/IDE can be generated 
with cmake. On all supported platforms you can download the graphical 
cmake utility (cmake-gui) and do this with a few clicks. For details check the documentation wiki: http://code.google.com/p/virtualawesome/wiki/GettingStarted
